# Global-Superstore-Analysis-Power-BI-Project
 I developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to analyze sales performance across global markets, with a focus on Multiple regions.  The dashboard provides deep insights into Furniture, Office, Technology sales by drilling down from Market, Segment to customer level. 

Key Business Insights Uncovered:
-  Identified Top Performing Markets:
The APAC and EU regions contributed to over 60% of global sales, but had an average profit margin of just 14%—highlighting opportunities for pricing and cost optimization.
-  Return Rate Hotspots:
“Home Office” segment saw a return rate 2.3× higher than others, flagging potential quality or targeting issues.
-  Shipping Cost & Delivery Delays:
“First Class” shipping mode incurred 22% higher cost per order than “Standard” with no measurable speed advantage across low-margin products—suggesting a switch could save $12K/year.
-  Customer Profitability Gaps:
Top customer “Tamara Chand” generated $18K+ in sales but had a below-average profit margin of 8.4%, pointing to volume-driven discount erosion.
-  Product-Level Optimization:
“Canon imageCLASS” printer drove high sales but ranked in bottom 10% by profit margin, flagging a need to revisit bundling or markup.
 Tools Used: Power BI  DAX  Power Query  Data Modeling
 Goal: Enable data-driven decision-making across sales strategy, customer targeting, and operational efficiency.
